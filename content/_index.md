# Deploy Open Platform for Enterprise AI (OPEA) Chat Q&A on AWS

### Overall
 In this hands-on workshop, you will learn how to deploy a sample Generative AI (GenAI) application on AWS EKS using OPEA and AWS CloudFormation. Youâ€™ll explore best practices for building GenAI infrastructure on AWS and leverage OPEA components to simplify deployment, allowing you to focus on developing and optimizing your application rather than configuring complex infrastructure from scratch. Additionally, you will implement guardrails to manage application behavior and enhance performance by integrating AWS services like OpenSearch.

For those who finish early, optional exercises will be available, providing alternative approaches to running LLM models in a serverless environment within your RAG deployment.
